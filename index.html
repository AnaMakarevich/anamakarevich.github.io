	<h1>Welcome to my playgroud!</h1>
	<p>Hi, everyone! I'm Ana (aka SuperCatman). I've recently graduated with a degree in Computer Science and now preparing for the Master's degree and studying Data Science.</p>
	<p>I think maths is the most important thing in data science and I'm taking time (even turning down really good offers) to close the gap I discovered when trying to read advanced books.</p>
	<p>I'm interested in applying data science in natural and social sciences.</p> 
	<p>I am also concerned about data ethics and I do believe the way the data is used today should be changed.</p>
