Hello, Earthlings!

It's 2019 and I've just realised that I can make a website on Github - it's not only for code, Karl! I was just looking for a place to share things that don't fit into lecture notes and are not pure code. I think Github is a great place to summarize what I've learned or discovered without all that social media stuff. 

I'm still very new to GitHub Pages and there is a lot to do to make this site look nice. And time is limited. But eventually it will look better, I promise.
